<h4>Mode Solution</h4>

<p><strong>This is another trickier exercise.&nbsp; Don't feel bad if you were unable to complete it!</strong><br></p>









<p>I start by defining the function, which accepts a single argument we'll call <code>collection</code>&nbsp;.</p>







<p>Next, I create a&nbsp;new dictionary that maps items in the collection to the number of times they appear in the collection. I used a dictionary comprehension along with <code>count()</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;to achieve this.</p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">count = {val: collection.count(val) for val in collection}</pre>



















<p>If collection was the string "happy", the resulting count dict would look like this:</p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">{
    'h': 1, 
    'a': 1, 
    'p': 2, 
    'y': 1
}

</pre>



















<p>Now, I&nbsp;just need to find the maximum number in all the values (2 in my example).&nbsp; To do that, I&nbsp;use</p>









<pre class="prettyprint linenums">max_value = max(count.values())
</pre>















<p>Now we know what the maximum value is, we just have to find the corresponding key. (we have 2, and need to work backwards to find 'p').&nbsp; This is harder than you might think.</p>

<p>I convert the values in the dict to a list.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do the same thing to all the keys.&nbsp; Then, I find the index of max_value in the values and use that to access the corresponding key.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint linenums">#find index of max_value in the values
correct_index = list(count.values()).index(max_value)
#use that index to find the correct key
return list(count.keys())[correct_index]
</pre>







<h4>Here is the complete code:</h4>









<p><br></p>











<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def mode(collection):
    count = {val: collection.count(val) for val in collection}
    # find the highest value (the most frequent number)
    max_value = max(count.values())
    # now we need to see at which index the highest value is at
    correct_index = list(count.values()).index(max_value)
    # finally, return the correct key for the correct index (we have to convert cou)
    return list(count.keys())[correct_index]</pre>
